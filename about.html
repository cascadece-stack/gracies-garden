        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Gracie's Garden began as a small passion project when our founders discovered the incredible world of mycology. With a love for sustainable agriculture and fresh food, they started cultivating gourmet mushrooms in their own backyard. What began as a hobby soon blossomed into a thriving farm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Gracie's Garden supplies restaurants and home cooks across Gulf Breeze, Florida with a variety of mushrooms grown using eco-friendly practices. We believe in the power of local food systems and strive to educate our community about the benefits of mushrooms and sustainable farming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gracie, our friendly mascot, represents the joy and wonder of the mushroom world and reminds us of our humble beginnings.
        </p>
